> You're on my list

You're a reasonable grey-ops sarariman with a short list of preferred assets.
You need to keep their digits in one place, easy to find and even easier
to navigate. 
What's an honest Johnson to do?
You want this program to store the deets you need. You don't care whether
the trog has a pet barghest; you just need to know if ze can make it through
a chrome scanner without melting down alarm bells.
Enter: Mr Johnson's Rolodex
It's slick. It's smooth. It's easy to use. Best of all, it's compact and it
won't break your petty cash box.


## User Story

```
AS A MR JOHNSON 
I WANT A CONTACT LIST
SO THAT I CAN KEEP TRACK OF MY RUNNERS
```

```
GIVEN THAT I HAVE A LIST OF CONTACTS
WHEN I LOOK AT THEM
THEN I WANT TO SEE A SUMMARY, BUT BE ABLE TO READ A DETAIL
WHEN I SCROLL THROUGH MY CONTACTS
THEN I WANT TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE FORWARD AND BACKWARD
WHEN I NEED TO ADD OR REMOVE A CONTACT
THEN I WANT IT TO BE QUICK AND EASY
WHEN I WANT TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT ALL MY CONTACTS
THEN I WANT TO SEE AN INDEX OVERVIEW AND NAVIGATE TO ANY RUNNER I WANT
```
